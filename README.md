# Overview of the Project:
# Project: API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION

# A] Objective:
To develop a Python-based solution that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it, and visualizes key metrics like temperature, humidity, and wind speed over time using data visualization libraries.

# B] Key Activities:
1. Fetching Weather Data: Access real-time weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API, Handle API requests and error responses.
2. Data Processing: Parse the JSON response from the API to extract relevant weather information. Create a structured pandas DataFrame with columns for date, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Convert date strings into datetime objects for accurate time-based analysis.
3. Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create line plots for: Temperature trends over time, Humidity trends over time, Wind speed trends over time, Customize plots with titles, labels, and colors for better interpretability.
4. User Interaction: Allow the user to specify the city for which they want to fetch weather data, Provide clear status messages during each step of the process (fetching, processing, visualizing).

# C] Technologies Used:
i] Programming Language: Python For data fetching, processing, and visualization.
ii] APIs: OpenWeatherMap API To retrieve weather forecast data in JSON format.
iii] Libraries: Requests To send HTTP GET requests to the API, Pandas For data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations, Seaborn For high-level data visualization with aesthetically pleasing graphics.
iv] Data Handling: JSON parsing for extracting specific weather details, pandas.DataFrame for organizing data into a tabular format.
v] Visualization Tools: Line plots for visualizing trends over time, Subplots for displaying multiple metrics in a single figure.
